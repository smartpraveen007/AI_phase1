Prediction of Energy Consumption using Machine Learning

About the dataset Time Series Datasets can be slightly tricky for using and coming up with the right predictions using Machine Learning algorithms and neural networks.Then i am going explain about my whole project.

#1. COLLECT DATASET AND DATA PREPROCESSING

1.Collect the data from various sources using smart meter and sensors. DATASET LINK:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robikscube/hourly-energy-consumption

2.Then these data are going to perform for data preprocessing techniques because of data might be contain unordered,anomaly and many format data are presented.so the data cleaning process to clean these data for required format.

Hence the cleaning data are transform into categorical data.In data there are many categories like text,photo,numerical ,etc.. so we need to transform this data for particular format.
#2.DATA VISUALIZING

1.The transformed data are used for various analysis like time series analysis,regression and so on.These analysis is done by python because python has many library files for data visualization such as matplotlib,pandas,seaborn.

2.This analysis is used to build a correct machine learning model for future prediction.

#3.BUILD MACHINE LEARNING MODEL

1.Importing required library files.Hence,such as matplotlib,pandas,numpy,seaborn,xgboost.

2.Then train and test split the data.one is train data and it is used for train the data from data sourece.another is test data and it used for test the data from test data.

3.visualize the feature to target relationship using plotting .

4.Hence build the strong machine learning model.then these model are going to work and give the results.

5.After build the ML model then the model going perform some operations or analysis such as feature importance,feature forecast on test,outlier analysis,reviewing train and test split,feature harizon and lag features,train using cross validation,fold analysis & retraining all data,predicting future.

#4.DEPLOYMENT

1.This is the final process of my project MEASURE ENERGY CONSUMPTION .

2Hence ,my project is running in real world environment using watson cloud or python flask.

3.This shows my energy consumption prediction approximately related to original result in graphical manner.

4.Then it is finally used for future purposed.# AI_phase1
